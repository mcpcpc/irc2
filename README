irc2 - a shell-based IRC client

A minimal solution that uses netcat for creating quick internet 
relay chat client connections. 

Usage
-----

Usage: irc2 [<server>] [<port>] [<nick>] [<username>] [<realname>]
	<server> 	Overrides the default host (irc.freenode.net)
	<port>		Overrides the default port (6667)
	<nick>		Override the default nick ($(id -un))
	<username>	Override the default user name ($nick)
	<realname>	Override the users real name ($nick)

Installation
------------

git clone http://github.com/mcpcpc/irc2
cd ircc
sudo install -Dm755 ircc "/usr/bin"

Examples
--------

To connect to the Freenode IRC server:
	irc2

Once connected, you can specify a channel to join the using `/join`
command (e.g. /join #kisslinux). Note that this will also set the
default message channel. To send a message to the recently joined 
channel, just type a message (without the forward-slash character).

To receive an alert if someone mentions your name:
	irc2 | awk '/nickname/ {printf "\a"}1'

To log your entire conversation history:
	script -a -c irc2 chat_log.txt

Credit

I really can't take credit for this project as this was purely 
community driven. Special thanks to aarng (for showing we the ways 
of "-e") and all the users on the #kisslinux IRC channel for the 
feedback and suggestions.
