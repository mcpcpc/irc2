ircc - irc client

A minimal viable POSIX shell solution for creating quick Internet Relay Chat
(IRC) connections.

Usage
-----

ircc [hostname] [port] [nickname]

Requirements
------------

Not much. ircc was designed and tested using the Busybox tools, so it should
work for a majority of environments.

Installation
------------

From source:
    git clone http://github.com/mcpcpc/ircc
    cd ircc
    sudo install -Dm755 ircc "/usr/bin"

Examples
--------

To connect to a Freenode server:
    ircc irc.freenode.net 6667 mcpcpc

Once connected, you can specify a channel to join (using "/[command]"). Note that
this will also set the default message channel:
    /join #kirc

To send a message to the recently joined channel, just type a message:
    hello world!
